          <h3>ALPHA DELICACY</h3>
          <p>
            Alpha Delicacy is a resturant that provide food to the satisfaction
            of the customer, the name Alpha Delicacy was first founded by a team
            of individals who call themselves Team Alpha and they are the ones
            who are responsible for the buying and selling that has been going
            on in this restorant. Under the leadership of Derek Emmanuel, they
            were able to prevail in the business. Alpha Delicacy specializes in
            different types of foods which consist of both local foods, native
            food and international foods. Alpha Delicacy, is made up of 7
            individuals and their images will be shown below. Food is any
            substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an
            organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and
            contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins,
            vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and
            assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain
            life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have
            different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique
            metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche
            within specific geographical contexts. Omnivorous humans are highly
            adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different
            ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main
            methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Below are some foods
            in Alpha Delicacy:Abacha is one dish that always takes me back to a
            place and time. That place is Enugu in Nigeria and it represents
            most of my childhood. I never bothered to learn how to make abacha
            until I left Enugu and couldn’t find good abacha. It was always
            available from street vendors, warm and spicy served with fried fish
            and assorted garnish. It is eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria and the
            Enugu people make the best! Abacha is made from cassava root, which
            has been peeled, cooked, grated and dried. I guess this is a
            preservation method to ensure that abacha was available all year
            round. Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried
            in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients
            such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by
            itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a
            popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South
            Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia and
            Malaysia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with
            ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless
            variations.Some people call this dish African salad, I guess it’s
            the closest thing we have to a salad with only local ingredients.
            Amala is mostly eaten in between meals, at hangout spots. I usually
            do not fry mackerel because I consider it an oily fish and prefer to
            bake it but for Amala, I make an exception and its because I always
            had it that way.

          <h3>WHAT IS FOOD</h3>
          <p>
            Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for
            an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and
            contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins,
            vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and
            assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain
            life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have
            different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique
            metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche
            within specific geographical contexts. Omnivorous humans are highly
            adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different
            ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main
            methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural
            technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles
            with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their
            geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation
            of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of
            ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have
            mixed through forces like international trade and globalization,
            ingredients have become more widely available beyond their
            geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of
            different food traditions and practices. Today, the majority of the
            food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world
            is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food
            with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food
            processing and food distribution systems. This system of
            conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means
            that the food and agricultural system is one of the major
            contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of
            total greenhouse gas emissions.[2]
